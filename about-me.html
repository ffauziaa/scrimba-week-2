        <h2>My name is Fauzia, realizing who I am saved my life</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>I used to force myself to behave like an extrovert.</strong> Whenever I was myself, people
           misunderstood me and thought I was shy or antisocial or that I didn't like them or that I had nothing 
           to say.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things were terrible. I couldn't make friends and felt lonely. I couldn't find the solitary I needed
           and I couldn't understand myself and my thoughts. <br>

        </p>
        <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>I was almost broken when I finally realized that actually nothing was wrong with me.</strong>
          I was just different and I had tried to change myself for the longest time. Had fought lots of inner battles that left me more 
          exhasted and sick of the world. In order to fit, I used to ignore what I actualy wanted and who I truly was.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>But enough was enough!</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>I finally decided to reorganize my life and redefine myself</h3>
        <p>
          I learnt strategies for finding comfort in our noisy world. From using music to create bubbles of peace,
          to escaping to a quite place whenever I get an opportunity.           
        </p>
        <p>
          I adore the intensity and chaotic beauty of the world.
          <strong
            >But it's in quite spaces where I feel truly at home</strong
          >. If introversion were more valued by society, it could make a massive difference to our collective future.
          The unique attributes of introverts really are deep, quite strength. <br>
          And as Gandhi, put it, <strong>"In a gentle way, you can shake the world."</strong>
