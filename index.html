            <strong>The world can get really loud sometimes</strong>, as introverts our brains have some special needs. <br>
             Wether you're an introvert or extrovert, your brain releases two chemical substances by the names of 'Dopamine' and 'Acetylcholine'

              Introverts are everywhere, and our quite approach to life, our need for solitary time,
               isn't a flaw-it's a gift. The world feels like a place that rewards extroverts. Where being loud 
               is mistaken for being confident and happy. Where everyone has something to say but nobody listens. 
               For those who speak softly, it's easy to feel left out. People often think introverts are shy or antisocial.
               But these are misconceptions, introverts like anyone, can find socializing fun. But while parties leave extroverts 
               energized, after some time we need to recharge, away from everyone.

              Dopamine is like a hit of energy when we take risks or meet new people, known as the chemical of
               plessure, it makes extroverts feel GREAT 
              but the introverted brains are a bit sesitive to it and quickly get over-stimulated. That's why 
              we prefer the more slow-burn feeling we get
              when our brains relese acetylcholine. That happens when we concentrate, read, or focus our minds.
               It makes us introverts feel relaxed, alert and content.

              Instead of filling up space with small talk, we listen patiently, and make our words matter.
              We have few friends, but our connection is deep. We love spending time alone. It's when chaos of a 
              long day can finally settle. We can reflect and listen to our thoughts and eventually reconnect with ourselves.
              Only after that, are we ready to share with the world again.
